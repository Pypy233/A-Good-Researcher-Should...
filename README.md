# A Good-Researcher Should



## What should a good researcher do?

This problem makes confused for quite a long time. I got advice from some professors and researchers. They told me:

- A good researcher should count on his own.
- A good researcher should give out ideas instead of implementing.
- A good researcher should dig into a project and try all his best to solve the problem.
- A good researcher should explain the problem, the solution and thought as concisely as possible. 



## Start from scratch

Joining a project and starting from scratch is common but difficult. You take lead of whole project and make important judgements. Then you will evaluate your thoughts and change directions and make it run smoothly. You may enjoy the achievements or simply  take the blame for our failure.
